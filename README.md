# JOTB 2019
## What is this about ??

This workshop is aimed to help your team to build and deploy microservices through a CI/CD pipeline against a K8's cluster!

The session is intended to take **kubernetes beginners** or **without experience at all** into the Brave New World of Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery in a DevOps environment!

You will work individually to build and deploy against a kubernetes cluster a set of services which will structure a cloud native web app.

You will learn how to build, manage and deploy a cloud native application; kubernetes basic concepts in a practical way; how to manage the source control, continuous integration and continuous deployment of your cloud native app in a DevOps manner and finally you will setup your own CI/CD Pipeline.

This workshop is divided in 2 different parts.

A first part where all you need is a a command-line, and where you will learn or review some basic kubernetes concepts.

A second part where you will build your own CI/CD pipeline and automate the concepts previously learned. This second part is a fork of an originial # ORACLE Learning Library # workshop with some differences.
