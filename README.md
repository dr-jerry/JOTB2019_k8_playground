# JOTB 2019 - K'8s Playground

## What is this about ??

This workshop is aimed to help you to build and deploy microservices through a CI/CD pipeline against a K8's cluster!

The session is intended to take **kubernetes beginners** or **without experience at all** into the Brave New World of Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery in a DevOps environment!

You will work individually to build and deploy against a kubernetes cluster a set of services which will structure a cloud native web app.

You will learn or review many many things, such as how to build, manage and deploy a cloud native application; kubernetes basic concepts in a practical way; how to manage the source control, continuous integration and continuous deployment of your cloud native app in a DevOps manner etc , etc ...

This workshop is divided in **2 different parts**.

A **first part** where all you need is a a **command-line**, and where you will learn or review some **basic kubernetes concepts**.

A **second part** where you will build your own **CI/CD pipeline** and **automate** the concepts previously learned. This second part is a fork of an originial **ORACLE Learning Library workshop** with some differences. 

Along the workshop you'll find many tips and links for some theory and basic concepts. If you're new to kubernetes, please invest a few minutes reading these links. You will see that when you understand the theory the practical exercices will make much more sense!

## What do you need to start ?

- A command-line (windows, mac or linux)

## "Well, I suppose I will need access to a kubernetes cluster ?! Right ??" Yes you do!

And you will have access to a Oracle Container Services instances or OKE for Oracle Kubernetes Engine as is also knwon. OKE is a developer friendly, container-native, and enterprise-ready managed Kubernetes service for running highly available clusters with the control, security, and predictable performance of Oracleâ€™s Cloud Infrastructure. It automatically gets the latest Kubernetes updates and keeping 100% compatibility with the CNCF ecosystem without the management and administrative overhead.
